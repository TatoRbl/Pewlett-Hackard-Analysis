## Summary

In summary the company is a risk, because we have 72,458 employees near to retiring, and only 1,549 candidate suitable to promote.
So with this new data, we need to make plan to increase new talent in the company, new young talent that can be cheap to adquire, but
also we need to hire head hunters to key senior positions....
