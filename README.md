# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview

The main purpose of this analysis is to know how many employees that are still working in the company will be retiring soon and how to prepare us for the "Silver Tsunami".

## Results

-In certain good news only 2 managers are close to retiring
-In bad news we have a total of 72,458 employees near to retiring
-Senior Staff and Senior Engineer are the 70% of the total employees near to retiring
-We only have 1,549 candidates to promote


## Summary

In summary the company is a risk, because we have 72,458 employees near to retiring, and only 1,549 candidate suitable to promote.
So with this new data, we need to make plan to increase new talent in the company, new young talent that can be cheap to adquire, but
also we need to hire head hunters to key senior positions....
